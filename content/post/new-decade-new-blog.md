If you've been following our [macandwentravelling](https://macandwentravelling.wordpress.com/) blog, you would've noticed it's been a little quiet in there since the end of 2018. With the onset of winter, weekend trips gave way to movie nights and museum visits, and there wasn't much to write about. Summer was short but intense, including a visit to Brazil and a road trip in Scotland (posts to come!). Then life got very busy, new job, new house, new routine - blogging took a backseat. We won't blame you if you thought *macandwentravelling* has died a slow, painful death. Well, in fact, it sort of has.

As the new decade starts, *macandwentravelling* gives way to *macandwen.com*. We will still write mostly about travelling, but not exclusively. If we read a meaningful book, we'll share our enthusiasm about it here. If we see a great play or watch an enlightening film, we might describe our impressions on the blog. Look out also for guest posts written by our friends, good recipes, some geeky articles about computer science, board game reviews and whatever else we become passionate about in the future.

Keep your fingers crossed and wish us luck for the future!
