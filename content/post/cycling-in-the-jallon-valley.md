## Description

Jalón Valley is quite a cycling mecca - tens of kilometers of perfect asphalt, beautiful scenery, little traffic; given fantastic weather in Costa Blanca (more than 300 sunny days per year on average), it's no wonder many professional cycling teams come here for winter training. This route covers most of the area and serves well as an introduction to the region.

Tip: if you're a cycling enthusiast (as in, not only riding but also following the Tour) and wanna try your luck at meeting pros, check out Velosol Cycling Bar in Jalón.

Big thanks to Rob (@lighttrapper_photography) for guiding us on this ride and taking pictures (the better ones from below).
