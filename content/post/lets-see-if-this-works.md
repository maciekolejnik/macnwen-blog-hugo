Quick introduction - this blog is aimed to keep track of our little adventures, show off our pictures and in the meantime, give you some tips we wish we knew beforehand. 

We are two Imperial students based in Windsor - one graduated from Maths & Computer Science, currently doctoring at Oxford; the other, graduated from Electrical and Electronic Engineering and now working as a Systems Engineer at Cisco. We have travelled as far as Hawaii and as close as Chiltern Hills. Literally, the Baltic states plus some lands in deep Eastern European are the only countries we have not visited within Europe. We know how to travel on a budget whilst having fun: we've taken cross Atlantic flights for less than £150, we've driven more than 1000 miles under a week with petrol covered thanks to BlaBlacar and walked 30 km in Yosemite with half a litre of water and a crunchy peanut butter bar!

Quick useful little posts will come every week (or monthly, when we get lazy; or yearly, when we get busy) - so keep checking!
