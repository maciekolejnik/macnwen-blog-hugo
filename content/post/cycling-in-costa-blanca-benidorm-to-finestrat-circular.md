## Description

An enjoyable ride which can serve either as a few hours long afternoon/after work activity or a half-day activity, with a lunch or coffee break in Finestrat. Our aim in creating this route was to avoid busy roads at all costs, which is why it features some dirt roads and detours. We like to maximise our time in 'nature'. It is not too hard, however, to modify the path so that gravel is avoided and distance slightly shortened. That's especially recommended if you have a road bike with thin tyres and wanna minimise risk of them going flat.

The destination of this ride is Finestrat, a lovely mountainous *pueblo* located at the base of Puig Campana (second-highest peak in Alicante, a post about it coming soon). If time allows, have a stroll around its narrow streets, drink a ca√±a in one of local bars and appreciate a view from one of scenic points found in this historic village.
